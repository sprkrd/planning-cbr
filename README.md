# Learning heuristics for STRIPS planning

Structure of the project:

The main demonstrators are under the nb-example folder. They consist of
Jupyter notebooks. The main one is final_document.ipynb, which contains the
final document as a notebook (the same document has been compiled without
the source code in a PDF in the same folder, as final_document.pdf).

The implementation has been done in Python and is in the planning folder.
